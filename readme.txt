A disassembly of Sonic 1 S2 Edition

To build this, use build.bat if you're a Windows user, or build.lua otherwise. The built ROM will be called 's2built.bin'.

The Lua script requires Lua version 5.3. Earlier versions will cause errors about integer divisions ('//') and bit-shifts ('<<', '>>') not being recognised.
